## The Journey That Changed My Perspective

What started as a simple plan to visit Bhutan turned into one of the most transformative travel experiences I've ever had. Over 10 days, I journeyed from Gurgaon to Siliguri, then crossed into the serene monasteries of Paro, discovering a country that truly lives by different values.

The contrast was immediate—from the bustling construction chaos of Siliguri (with its endless roadwork around Sevoke Road and Bagdogra Airport) to Bhutan's peaceful, well-maintained roads. It felt like crossing into a different world entirely.

This isn't just a travel guide—it's my personal documentation of how Bhutan's philosophy of Gross National Happiness isn't just a government slogan, but something you can actually feel in the air, see in people's faces, and experience in every interaction.

## Personal Reflections

This journey taught me that happiness really can be a national priority. In Bhutan, I witnessed a society that values:
- **Environmental conservation** over economic growth
- **Cultural preservation** over modernization
- **Community well-being** over individual wealth
- **Spiritual development** over material accumulation

These aren't just ideals—they're lived realities that you experience in every interaction, every view, and every moment of peace you find in this incredible kingdom.
