## Chasing the Mountain Air: My Whirlwind Escape

Leaving behind the hustle of Gurgaon on the night of April 30th, our adventure began with a cozy bus ride courtesy of Laxmi Holidays from Kashmere Gate at 10:00 PM. After a comfortable overnight journey, we were greeted by the crisp morning air of Dharamshala around 9:00 AM the next day.

This wasn't just another hill station trip—it was my personal escape to discover the spiritual heart of the Himalayas, experience authentic Tibetan culture, and find peace in the mountain air.

| **Day 6** | Kareri Village - Zostel Plus | Village life, nature pool, valley exploration |
| **Day 7** | Dharamshala to Gurgaon | Evening bus departure, morning arrival |
