## The Descent into Silence

If Thimphu is the pulse of Bhutan, Punakha is its soul. The drive from the capital felt like a descent into a deeper, more ancient peace. For me, this was the highlight of the trip—the most silent, serene city I have ever encountered. Punakha doesn't demand your attention; it simply exists in a state of grace, wrapped in the arms of the mountains and the constant, rhythmic song of its rivers.

## Gliding Through Liquid Sapphires

We headed straight to the **Mo Chhu river** for rafting. But this wasn't the aggressive, bone-jarring rafting I’ve seen elsewhere. Here, the rapids are gentle, allowing you to simply soak in the grandness of the valley.

As the raft drifted, I felt a familiar set of words echoing in my mind—the lines from *Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara* after the scuba dive. It felt as though Javed Akhtar had written them for this very moment on the Mo Chhu:


>पिघले नीलम सा बहता हुआ येह समान
>नीली नीली सी खामोशियाँ
>ना कहीं है ज़मीन
>ना कहीं आसमान
>सरसराती हुयी टहनियाँ, पट्टियां
>केह रही है की बस एक तुम हो यहाँ
>सिर्फ मैं हूँ मेरी सांसें हैं और मेरी धडकनें
>ऐसी गहराइयाँ
>ऐसी  तनहाइयाँ
>और मैं सिर्फ मैं
>अपने होने पे मुझको यकीन आ गया

The water was shockingly cold—a reminder of the glaciers that birthed it—but the locals had arranged a **bonfire** afterward. Drying off by the crackling wood, the contrast of the freezing river and the biting warmth of the fire felt like the ultimate mountain luxury.

## The Palace of Great Happiness

The **Punakha Dzong** is a masterpiece of balance. It is divided into two worlds: the administrative and the monastic. We walked into the monastery section just as a ceremony was unfolding.

The air was heavy with the scent of butter lamps and ancient wood. The low, guttural hums of the monks, the rhythmic heartbeat of the drums, and the haunting melody of traditional instruments created a wall of sound that felt like a physical embrace. We sat there, eyes closed, and meditated. In that space, between the chants and the silence, the world outside simply ceased to exist.

### Bridges and Surprises

Not far from the fortress, we crossed the famous **Suspension Bridge**, one of the longest in Bhutan. Amidst the fluttering prayer flags and the rush of the wind, I found something entirely unexpected: **Golgappe**. To my surprise, they were better than many I’ve had back home—a sharp, spicy burst of familiarity in the middle of the Himalayan wilderness.

In a rare break from the city's usual silence, we stumbled upon a **local football match**. Watching the raw excitement of the crowd and the rush of a goal being scored was a beautiful reminder that even in a place of such stillness, the spirit of play is very much alive.

## The Wind and the Divine Madman

A short 200m hike through emerald-green fields led us to **Chimi Lhakhang**, the Fertility Temple. The story of the "Divine Madman" and his unorthodox path to nirvana adds a layer of quirky, human charm to Bhutan’s deep spirituality. At the top, the wind is swift and relentless, carrying the scent of the valley up to the temple walls. Standing there, looking out at the sprawling greens, the sense of scale is breathtaking.

## Carrot Cake and Morning Mist

Our culinary journey in Punakha was defined by the **Garuda Cafe**. We spent hours there, refilling our souls with **Thukpa**, spicy **Chilly Potato**, and their legendary **Carrot Cake**. There’s something about the vegetable markets here—the produce looks so vibrant, so full of life—that even a simple bowl of noodles tastes like a revelation.

My mornings were reserved for solitary walks. Walking through Punakha in the early mist, you realize that this city is about nature’s grandness and the beauty of being still. It’s a place that makes you promise yourself: *I will come back here, again and again.*
